# Hi!

## My name is Andres Claro and this...

...is the config file for my _GitHub_ profile and in this space I'm going to talk a little bit about myself and my interests 🤓.

👨🏻 I'm a 24 years old foreing languages student but I'm deeply apasionated with programming and the tech world in general, I've spent a lot of time watching videos from a _YouTube_ channel called [Nate Gentile](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC36xmz34q02JYaZYKrMwXng) among others videos of people programing which made my love for this world increase over the years, but I never took the time to learn programming until the beginning of 2023, why? Not sure myself honestly but here am I.

✍🏻So far, since Feb 1st 2023 I've learning _HTML_, _CSS_ and I want to learn _JavaScript_ to start with frontend as per usual and from there move forwards to backend and other things. I'm not an expert by now but I'm making this README file to keep a record of my achievements until now, this of course makes me a newbie but everyone was a newbie once, right?.

🐉Anyways, here's what I have learned so far **02/19/23**:

🫡It maybe something simple for a lot of people, but hey! I've never get in touch with any of this so for me is a great advancement!!!. As for the source of this courses is a teacher and Youtuber called Jon MirCha, here's his [YouTube Channel](https://www.youtube.com/@jonmircha) to which I got the chance to get in touch by recommendation of a friend who is a systems engineer and he said it would be a good start. [Jon Mircha Webpage](https://jonmircha.com/) is a person who I admire due to his ability to explain and teach thoroughly each one of this topics. Of course I have read parts of the documentation of each topic, I've practiced a lot and I've got other sources as well, but Jon MirCha has been the guiding hand for me and I'm very thankful for it.
